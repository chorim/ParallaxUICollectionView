# ParallaxUICollectionView

My version of a straightforward parallax effect in a UICollectioView. The goal was for the code to be as simple as possible so you can copy paste it into your project. I don't think there is any need for a custom component for this. 

You can alter the parallax characteristics, i.e. the distance that the image appears to be, with parallaxFactor in the cell. 

* It's written in Swift 
* Using a storyboard to setup the UICollectionView and Cell 
* The demo images are in an assets catalog.
* You can switch the scrolling direction to vertical or horizontal
