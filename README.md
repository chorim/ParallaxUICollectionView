# ParallaxUICollectionView

My version of the simplest possible code (that's not a challenge!) to do a full screen, horizontally scrolling UICollectionView with parallax effect.

You can alter the parallax characteristics, i.e. the distance that the image appears to be, with parallaxFactor in the cell. 

It's written in Swift, using a storyboard to setup the UICollectionView and the UICollectionViewCell and the demo images are in an assets catalog.
